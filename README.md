- Hi, I’m @junalaa :D
- I’m interested in 3DS Hacking and making my own website. Already got big plans for that but lacking skill.
- I’m currently learning html and css for that reason. Also need to make a shitton of pixel art for the site so I suppose I'll also learn a lot about that in the process.
